        <p><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" >Laravel Fortify</a>  is a frontend agnostic authentication backend implementation for Laravel. Fortify registers the routes and controllers needed to implement all of <strong>Laravel's</strong> authentication features, including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and more. After installing Fortify, you may run the route:list Artisan command to see the routes that Fortify has registered.

            <i>Since <b> Fortify </b> does not provide its own user interface, it is meant to be paired with your own user interface which makes requests to the routes it registers. We will discuss exactly how to make requests to these routes in the remainder of this documentation.</i>
